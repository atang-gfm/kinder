    funddescription:
      "update: i’ve decided to reduce the goal of this fundraiser to $5000 as there is a bit of urgency specific to scheduling surgery. we’re so very close, and i thank each and everyone one of you for your generosity!!!    many of you know and love ms. pat from the moores mill rd publix. she’s worked as a cashier for publix for 19 years, having previously worked at two publix locations including the howell mill/collier rd location. she works full time, saves when she can, and is in desperate need of a second total hip replacement but doesn't have the funds necessary for her co-pay. her pain is debilitating, constant, and there is little that can be done to help her without surgery. following surgery, ms. pat will require several months of rest and rehab in order to heal. another group set up a gfm for her too and it was super successful. that money is in the bank. the $5000 we’re hoping to raise will help fund co -pays, rent, utilities, gas, etc. living expenses and medical bills only. thank you for your  consideration!!",

    fundname: `"Undefeated '64" Documentary Film`,
    funddescription: `my name is brandon brito. i'm an independent filmmaker residing in revere, massachusetts. i'm currently raising funds for my first full-length documentary: "undefeated '64," which tells the unusual story of the 1964 revere high school football team. the 1964 revere patriots were the only team in the school's history to go undefeated throughout the season, winning seven games and tying only one. however, a controversial ruling before the last game of the season erased their undefeated record. they were forced to forfeit all of their games leading up to their class b championship matchup against their undefeated arch-rival winthrop. no longer eligible to play for the championship, the team had no choice but to play for pride. playing in front of a crowd of over 7,000 people, the patriots beat the vikings 8-0 at home, and earned the respect of their opponents and the city as a whole. this film will provide the players a chance to reflect back and share their own perspectives on what happened that season, provide insight on where they are now, and how playing on that team shaped their lives as athletes and as men. i came across an internet comment on this team while researching a few years back. before that, i knew nothing about them. what surprised me most is how little they're represented today, which motivated me to make this film. i believe that this film has potential to touch the hearts of current and former revere athletes, as well as current and former athletes from cities like revere. funds will be used to cover all production costs, which include travel, equipment, possible distribution of the film, etc. any donation would be fully appreciated!`,

      "hello everyone, my 87 year old grandpa has been in and out of the er for the past week with his own medical conditions, and at the same time, his beloved cat pumpkin became very ill and refused to eat and drink for 3 days (she had ample water and food available with many different varieties). yesterday, we found pumpkin unable to move and rushed her to the vet. after many tests, she was diagnosed with a pyometra infection, and the care and surgery to cure her is going to cost $20,000.       my grandpa first brought pumpkin in from his backyard right before hurricane sandy when she was only a couple weeks old and most likely would have died in the storm. they have spent the last 10 years together keeping each other company.      my grandpa is planning to put his cat first and pay for the surgery himself; however, this care would require half of his life’s savings, and we worry if he is going to be able to afford his own current and future medical bills. any amount given would be greatly appreciated.",

      "hi, my name is izzie and i am putting this campaign together to help my dear friend, anna horn, afford emergency vet care for her 3 year old cat-son mar mar. he is an otherwise healthy cat but was rushed the night of 5/26 to the nearest emergency vet after not being interested in food or being able to use the litterbox all day. the complication was found to be a block in his urinary tract, a common but frightening health issue that a lot of male cats have, and thankfully mar mar is now in stable condition. money donated will be used to help cover various bills from the emergency vet such as, the emergency check up , the cost of transfer from the emergency vet to a different overnight facility, blood tests, xrays, and the iv that he needs to be hooked up to for a minimum of 24 hours to up to 3 days.   the sooner the better would be  appreciated for donations, as rent is due in less than a week and an unforeseen $3,000 expense is quite a lot to recover from for anyone, and anna is recently graduated and out of savings from paying off school loans while working her position as a health educator for a non-profit. anna is a wonderful cat parent and a fantastic friend and she had finally cat-proofed her apartment to make it safe for her to bring mar-mar home with her from her dad's house, and she deserves to be able to enjoy spending time with him in their new home without having to worry about more credit card debt or personal loans.   i am incredibly grateful if you are able to donate a few dollars and if you do not have the means to do so, a share is also very appreciated (:   thank you for taking the time to look at this and for helping to give a covid-era college graduate a little bit less to worry about. love and blessings to all",
